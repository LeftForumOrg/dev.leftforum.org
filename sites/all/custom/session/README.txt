Changed functions or behaviors from the developer's standard:
1) Under "session.module", function "session_form_submit()" was added with the intention to check if any text was written into the "unregistered presenters" field, and if that can be turned into a new user account, wherein an email is sent to the user to claim the account.

2) Added 'Full Name', 'Email' fields, and the 'unregistered_presenters' field group.
